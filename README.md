## Education			        		
- B.S. Computer Science, Lehman College, CUNY (2021 -2024)
- Break Trough Tech AI, ML Cornell Tech Fellow (2022 -2023)

## Work Experience

**ML engineer @ Cake.AI (Septermber - October 2024)**
- Developed, researched, debugged, tested, deployed and documented AutoML solutions and scalable pipeline components for Data Scientist teams. Utilized latest open source frameworks such as Autoviz, Feast, Pycaret, Docker, Ray, Kubernetes, Lense, AWS. 

**Data researcher & engineer @ MTA C&D (June - August 2024)**
- Developed an application for MTA Data analytics teams  that helps to clean, verify and preprocess data within seconds instead of days, which resulted in a 200% efficiency increase.
- Analyzed the MTA data, and built an ML model that predicted an efficient usage of the resources for the C&D team.

**SWE & Computer Vision research at Cornell Tech (June - September 2023)** 
- Developed a scoring system for an image processing pipeline (tracks conditions - distance, angle, lighting). The scoring system delivers the pipeline performance score, and gives feedback on how an image processing pipeline performed under the conditions.
- Have collected/labeled 11K+ dataset, successfully utilized and developed solutions using OpenCV and python programming.
